# Hobby Page
This is a hobby page for my founders and coders application.

## Steps i took to make the website
- I started work on the site at the Founders and Coders Meetup, using what i had learnt from FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Classes.
- I encountered some issues with coding the site so I took a step back and decided I needed a plan. 
- I came up with a basic plan in Figma (see the .pdf in this respository)
- I returned to editing HTML and CSS, this time much more focussed, now I had a clear idea of what I wanted the site to look like.  
- **Add things here **
- In struggled to get the site's footer to stick to the bottom of the page, so I used the developer tools to test several different ways of doing it (found by googling and reading stack overflow articles). I liked the speed with which developer tools allowed me to do this. The solution was using: {bottom:0px and position:fixed}
- From there I debugged the site using my mobile and the responsive design mode in Firefox developer tools and made several edits as necessary.
