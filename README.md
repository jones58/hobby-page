# Hobby Page
This is a hobby page for my founders and coders application.

## Steps i took to make the website
- I started work on the site at the Founders and Coders Meetup, using what i had learnt from FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Classes.
- I encountered some issues with coding the site so I took a step back and decided I needed a plan. 
- I came up with a basic plan in Figma (see the .pdf in this respository)
- I returned to editing HTML and CSS, this time much more focussed, now I had a clear idea of what I wanted the site to look like.  

For a more detailed explanation of how I made this site over time, see the commmits.
